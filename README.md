## Description
A Java program that calculates the current value of a car based on its model year, purchase price, and the current year. The program uses a depreciation formula to determine how much the car's value decreases over time. It prints the car's model year, purchase price, and its current estimated value. 

Depreciation Formula: The car's value decreases by 15% each year. The formula used to calculate the current value is:  
```Java
currentValue = purchasePrice * (1 - depreciationRate)^carAge 
```

```Java
public void calcCurrentValue(int currentYear) {
       double depreciationRate = 0.15;
       int carAge = currentYear - modelYear;
       
       // Car depreciation formula
       currentValue = (int) 
          Math.round(purchasePrice * Math.pow((1 - depreciationRate), carAge));
    }
```

Where:  depreciationRate is 0.15 (15%) carAge is the difference between the current year and the model year

## Installation Requirements
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use a package manager like Homebrew for macOS or apt-get for Linux. 

- Clone or download the repository: 
```Java 
- git clone https://github.com/EMK2473/CarValue.git 
```

- Navigate to the project directory: 
```Java
- cd CarValue 
```
- Compile the CarValue.java file: 
```Java
- javac CarValue.java 
```
- Run the program: 
```Java
- java CarValue
```

## Application Usage
The program prompts the user to input three values: the carâ€™s model year, its purchase price, and the current year. It then calculates the car's depreciation and outputs the model year, original purchase price, and current value of the car.  Example: 

Input:  
```Java
2015 
20000 
2023 
```
Output: 
```Java
Car's information:   
  Model year: 2015   
  Purchase price: $20000   
  Current value: $13019
```

## Test Commands
To test the program, provide different model years, purchase prices, and current years to verify that the depreciation is calculated correctly.
